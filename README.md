# avr-utils README

Welcome to **`avr-utils`**.

This extension helps users to write and compile code for their avr microcontrollers straight from the comfort of their favourite Code editor, **VScode**

## !! New !!
- Progress bar when downloading toolchain.
- Better error message diagnostics (Big Improvement!)

## Features

-   ### Projects: Creating and importing

    -   #### >> Create Or Import

        ![IMAGE](assets/readme/1a-create-or-import.mp4.gif)

        > **You can create a new avr project or import an existing project created from Microchip/Atmel studio.**

        <p>After making a choice, VSCode will ask you to choose a folder. </p>

        -   If opening a Microchip project, it asks for the project folder of your **existing project**.
        -   If creating a new project, it asks for the folder to put the project in, then it asks for a **name** for the project (then asks for permission to load the project if you already have another project open in the editor).<br><br>

    -   #### >> No Toolchain?

        You may want to build the opened/newly creared project, but you encounter a popup saying you have no toolchain.

        Don't worry, you just have to download a new toolchain (**you don't have to have Microchip Studio**), or if you already have `Microchip Studio` on your device, you can choose to take time to locate the folder within the install directory of `Microchip Studio` which has the name "`avr8-**`" and contains the following folders, or at least 90% of them.

        ![folders](assets/readme/1c-toolchain-directory.png)<br>

        > Generally, I recommend downloading a new toolchain to save you the time.

    -   #### >> Select a device first

        ![IMAGE](assets/readme/1d-select-first-prompt.mp4.gif)

        Before running a successful build in **`c`**, you need to select a microcontroller so that **avr-gcc** does not give build errors.
        <hr>
        ![IMAGE](assets/readme/1e-select-and-build.mp4.gif)

        Once you build the project successfully, you will get a `.elf` file, a `.hex` file and an `.o` file created for you within the Debug folder in your project.

-   ### Code Completions

    -   #### >> Toolchain headers and Project headers

        Within the "`main.c`" file or any other project file in **`c`**, you can get completions for the **avr-gcc** headers or the project-level headers.

        ![IMAGE](assets/readme/2a-completions.mp4.gif)

    -   #### >> Header document links

        You can easily open header files if you need to read documentation or edit them through the links provided as shown below.

        ![IMAGE](assets/readme/2b-header-links.mp4.gif)

-   ### Object Definitions

    -   #### >> Device header files

        After selecting a device, you can access it's definitions like for registers like `DDRA` or `PORTA`. If the device has a register, you can press `Ctrl` or `Cmd` and click the register variable using your pointer to get taken to the definition, and of course if the register doesn't exist on the selected device, you won't get definitions.

        ![IMAGE](assets/readme/3a-definitions-from-device-headers.mp4.gif)

        Of course, this works on variables and functions too.

    -   #### >> Project header files

        Header files within the project directory can also contribute to the definitions. In general, any file that you "`#include`" will contribute to the definitions.

<!-- ## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them. -->

## Command Palette Contributions

The extension comes with some settings added to the command palette. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and type "**AVR Utils**" to view them.

-   `Open Microchip Project`: You can use this to open a project folder for a project created using Microchip Studio (a.k.a Atmel Studio)
-   `Create Project`: This is used to create a new project. This command also creates for you some very minimal boilerplate code in `c` to get you started.

-   `Build/Compile`: This command only appears when the project has been opened and there is an active `c` file. <br>Take note that this command can also be invoked simply by pressing `F5` on your keyboard, or by the Build button at the bottom of the VSCode window.

## Settings Contributions

The extension also now has some settings accessible from `Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,` and then search for "**AVR Utils**":

-   `Show terminal at each build`: This setting is useful to ensure that there are no build errors arising from your code since an extension cannot directly get `stdout` from the terminal to parse errors. You can turn this off in case you don't need it.

## Known Issues

If you have the extension `ms-vscode.cpptools` installed, it will cause red squiggles in your code, plus it will create extra buttons in the ui which may not build your AVR.<br>
Therefore to solve this, I registered a new language called "`AVR C`" which handles the same file extension `.c` and so if you need to use your IDE for normal C development, you can just switch the language as shown below.
